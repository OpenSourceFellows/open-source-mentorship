### Why join a hack pod? 
Make new friends across the industry in similar roles as you 
Opportunities to practice leadership:  It is also a great opportunity for those who wish to gain more experience in handling the responsibilities of a more senior engineer or team lead
Each hour counts towards donation credits since you‚Äôre volunteering with GitHub Education 
Use this in your next reflection for customer facing activity (template)

### What are hack pods? 

A Hack Pod is a 1-2 hour engagement between our GitHub teams and a customer/partner as we uncover places we can create reference architectures that act as starting points for customer adoption. 

Open source fellows (maintainers of this repo) drive the projects to completion/maintain them. We aim to continue giving back to open source by fostering the next generation of developers.

**What is the stack?** 

üñº üé® ‚öôÔ∏è Fullstack development stack uses Vue, Node, and Postgres. üîç QA uses Jest and Typescript.

**What is a successful pair hour/overall program look like?**
- learning has happened! Whether its about the stack or the SDLC in general
- Sometimes that looks like..
  - having an outline of tasks to accomplish on an issue debugging and getting people 
  - 'unstuck' within a rough draft PR
  - code review of a PR
  - What experience do students have? students are coming with some GitHub experience and stacks related to Javascript and Ruby.
