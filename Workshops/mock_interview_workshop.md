 As part of our ongoing commitment to enabling open source maintainers from all backgrounds - especially early careers - we're excited to offer an hour 1:1 micro-mentoring session. This is an opportunity for attendees and our community partners to engage with industry experts (aka Hubbers :MLH: ) on career pathing and feedback. Please note, that this is open to all Hubbers and does not require a technical background.
