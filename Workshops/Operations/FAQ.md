# Tips and Tricks for Presenting on Zoom


- Use "presenter mode" in Google Slides, this will put your presentation into fullscreen mode and give you a separate presenter's window which will let you flip through sides, see speaker notes, and see a timer. 
- On Zoom, when you share your screen select the *browser window* that contains your fullscreen presentation to share
  - Note that this will share the browser window including its other tabs, make sure you're using another window if you want to open another tab and not present it!
- To share another window or application, click "new share" in the Zoom meeting controls
- If you're using a Mac, put it into "Do Not Distrub" mode for your presentation.  https://www.lifewire.com/turn-on-do-not-disturb-mac-4690079
