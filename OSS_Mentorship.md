## What is an Open Source Mentor?

Advocats are working with MLH to provide student fellows first hand open source experience through working on [ProgramEquity](https://programequity.notion.site/ProgramEquity-6795c87b9a4a4eeea868294eacdb957c)‚Äôs project [Amplify](https://github.com/ProgramEquity/amplify) and  career-related workshops. To learn more about the MLH Open Source Fellowship, go [here](https://fellowship.mlh.io/programs/open-source).

## How it Works

Advocats runs 10 week long sessions for [MLH Fellows]() with weekly [Workshops](Workshops/README) on various engineering topics and [Pair Hours](Pair_Hours/README) where students work with mentors on the [Amplify app](https://github.com/ProgramEquity/amplify)

We look for 10-12 Hubbers to be mentors for Pair Hours and 25-35 Hubbers to present workshops for each 10 week cohort.
