## What is an Open Source Mentor?

[View Our 2022 Impact Report](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFW7oovgdE/TTiES7OrTGG4hkeSGcofKQ/view?utm_content=DAFW7oovgdE&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=viewer)

Open source mentors provide student fellows first hand open source experience through working on [ProgramEquity](https://programequity.notion.site/ProgramEquity-6795c87b9a4a4eeea868294eacdb957c)‚Äôs project [Amplify](https://github.com/ProgramEquity/amplify) via [pair hours](./Pair%20Hours/README.md), career-related and technical [workshops](./Workshops/README.md), and [content labs](./Content%20Labs/README.md)

To learn more about the MLH Open Source Fellowship, go [here](https://fellowship.mlh.io/programs/open-source).

## How it Works

Mentors run 10 week long sessions for [MLH Fellows]() with weekly [Workshops](./Workshops/README.md) on various engineering topics and [Pair Hours](./Pair_Hours/README.md) where students work with mentors on the [Amplify app](https://github.com/ProgramEquity/amplify)

We look for 10-12 people to be mentors for Pair Hours and 25-35 people to present workshops for each 10 week cohort.
