## üìã Blog Outline: Write your outline in the issue directly 
### Requirements 
`Questions to consider:`
- Who‚Äôs reading this? Where are they in your dev journey? What do they need to know before they can dive into this story?

`Sample Topics for your blog post`
- Creating tests for Stripe/Cicero/Twilio
- Using Vuetify and V-cards

> - What inspired you from the Tech documentation workshop?
> - What would you help encourage other first time contributors to do?
> - Is a learning curve for everyone? And whats the balance between good documentation and too much documentation? Choice architecture
